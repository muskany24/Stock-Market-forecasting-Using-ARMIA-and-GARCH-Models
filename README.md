**Stock Forecasting Using ARIMA and GARCH Models**

This project analyzes and forecasts the closing prices and volatility of major Indian bank stocks using time series modeling techniques. It applies ARIMA models to capture linear trends and structure in stock prices and selectively uses GARCH models to capture volatility clustering, where statistically significant.

**Key steps include:**

1) Data cleaning and log return computation

2) ADF test and differencing to achieve stationarity

3) ACF/PACF-based parameter selection for ARIMA and GARCH

4) Residual diagnostics and Ljung-Box test

5) Rolling forecasts and conditional volatility analysis

6) Visualization of actual vs forecasted prices for 90-day horizons

7) GARCH models were applied to INDUSINDBK and BAJAJFINSV, where volatility behavior was prominent and model parameters were statisticallyÂ significant.
